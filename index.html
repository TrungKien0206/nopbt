    <h1>This is <i> Still </i>a motherfucking website.</h1>
    <p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>
    <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>
    <p><strong>7 fucking declarations.</strong></p>
    <p>
      That's how much CSS it took to turn that
      <a href="#">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read <br />
      masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <i>still</i> has all the glory
      of the original perfect-ass <br />
      website:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shit's <i>still</i> lightweight and loads fast</li>
      <li><i>Still</i> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
      <li><i>Still</i> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
      <li>
        The motherfucker's <i>still</i> accessible to every asshole that visits
        your site
      </li>
      <li>Shit's <i>still</i> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
    <p>
      You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site.
      Here's how.
    </p>
    <h2>Let it breathe</h2>
    <p>
      Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming
      they're not <br />
      married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash - pick
      a minimum <br />
      <code><b>line-height : 1.4</b></code>

      for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see <br />
      that...piss off.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see
      a book like that?
    </p>
    <p>Yes? What a shitty book.</p>
    <h2>A little less contrast</h2>
    <p>
      Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life?
      Tone it down a <br />
      bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice
      <code> <b>#EEEEEE</b></code> if I wasn't so <br />
      focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.
    </p>
    <h2>Size Matters</h2>
    <p>
      I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to
      render close to <br />
      <code>16px</code> or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the
      screen.
    </p>
    <h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
    <p>
      Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of
      text that's <br />
      200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might
      actually read more <br />
      than one sentence of your worthless dribble.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Yes, this is <code><i>also</i></code> fucking satire, you fuck
    </h3>
    <p>
      I love what the creator of <a href="#"> this site's inspiration</a> did.
      What I'm saying is that it's so, so <br />
      simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they
      are functional, <br />
      high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and
      all the other web <br />
      designers out there need to make them not total shit.
